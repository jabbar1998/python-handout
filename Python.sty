the first day Iwant begin Python 

We have intiger structher and string and float boolian but we dont need to say python 

you can use ' ' and "" for show string  |  if you whant know file type you can use type()

For loop : while and for

For Condition you can use : if 

For Entrance Value : input ()

if You want equal == and you can use ' is ' but ' is ' for equl type and the amount of but == just for the amount of


the ===> operator => values are equal

the ' is ' operator => point to the same object 


falsyness => empty objects , zero or 0 , empty string  , None
